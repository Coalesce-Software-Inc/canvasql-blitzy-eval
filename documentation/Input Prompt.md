Collaborative ERD Visualization Tool - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A real-time collaborative web application that enables multiple users to visualize, annotate, and interact with Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) generated from SQL DDL statements. The platform will facilitate better database design discussions and documentation among team members.

## Problem Statement

Database architects and developers need to collaborate on database designs in real-time, but existing tools either lack collaboration features or don't provide intuitive visualization capabilities. Current solutions often require manual ERD creation or don't support real-time multi-user interactions.

## Target Users

- Database Architects

- Data Engineers

- Software Developers

- Data Analysts

- Technical Product Managers

- Database Administrators

## Core Features

### 0. Database Connection

- Connect to various database systems, starting with Snowflake and Postgres

- Import schema from a database

- Export schema to a database

### 1. SQL DDL Processing

- Parse and interpret SQL DDL statements

- Support for multiple SQL dialects (Snowflake,PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)

- Validation and error handling for invalid SQL

- Auto-formatting of input SQL

- Support for incremental DDL additions

### 2. ERD Visualization

- Automatic layout generation

- Entity representation with table names and columns

- Relationship visualization with proper cardinality

- Color coding for primary/foreign keys

- Custom styling options for entities and relationships

- Zoom and pan controls

- Minimap for large diagrams

### 3. Collaboration Features

- Real-time multi-user editing

- User presence indicators

- Cursor tracking for other users

- Chat functionality (text and thread-based)

- User permissions (view, edit, admin)

- Session management

- Change history and undo/redo

### 4. Annotation Tools

- Sticky notes

- Drawing tools (arrows, shapes)

- Text annotations

- Comment threads on specific entities

- Custom labels and tags

- Color-coded annotations

### 5. Project Management

- Project workspaces

- Sharing controls

- Version history

- Export capabilities (PNG, PDF, SQL)

- Project templates

- Backup and restore

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- React 18+ with TypeScript

- State Management: Zustand

- UI Components: shadcn/ui

- Real-time sync: Y.js with WebSocket provider

- Canvas Rendering: React Flow

- Styling: Tailwind CSS (core utilities only)

### Backend

- Node.js with Express

- WebSocket server for real-time updates

- SQL Parser: sqlite-parser

- Authentication: Auth.js

- Database: sqlite for user data and ease of admin and use

- Redis for session management

### Infrastructure

- Single server deployment

- Ease of local deployment

- Can be ran on any standard server (Linux or MacOS)

## User Interface Components

### Main Canvas

The main canvas is implemented using React Flow, providing an interactive diagram workspace with the following features:

#### Components

- **EntityNode**: Custom node component for displaying database tables

  - Renders table name as header

  - Lists columns with types and constraints

  - Visual indicators for primary and foreign keys

  - Support for dragging and repositioning

- **RelationshipEdge**: Custom edge component for table relationships

  - Displays cardinality (one-to-many)

  - Connects foreign keys to their referenced tables

  - Auto-routing to avoid overlaps

#### Interaction Features

- Zoom controls (0.1x to 4x zoom range)

- Pan and drag navigation

- Snap-to-grid (20px intervals)

- Node dragging and repositioning

- Interactive minimap for navigation

- Fit-to-view functionality

#### State Management

- Persistent layout saving in browser storage

- Real-time position updates

- Automatic layout for newly imported tables

#### Current Limitations

- Manual relationship routing only

- Fixed cardinality representation (one-to-many)

- Basic node styling

- No custom edge styles or labels

#### Planned Improvements

- Custom node themes and styling

- Edge label customization

- Multiple cardinality types

- Smart auto-layout for large diagrams

- Group selection and bulk moving

- Relationship path customization

### Toolbar

- SQL Paste

- Select Database, Schema, Tables

- Annotation Tools

- Zoom Controls

- Sharing Options

- View Controls

- Chat Toggle

### SQL Input Modal

- Code editor with syntax highlighting

- Validation feedback

- Import from file option

- SQL dialect selection

### Collaboration Panel

- Active users list

- Chat interface

- Change history

- Comments feed

## Performance Requirements

- Initial load time \< 3 seconds

- Real-time updates \< 100ms latency

- Support for diagrams with up to 100 tables

- Concurrent users per workspace: 25

- Browser support: Latest 2 versions of major browsers

## MVP Features

1. Basic SQL DDL parsing (PostgreSQL only)

2. ERD visualization with auto-layout

3. Real-time collaboration for 2+ users

4. Basic annotation tools

5. Project sharing

6. Export to PNG

## Future Enhancements

1. AI-powered layout suggestions

2. Database connection for live schema import

3. Custom visualization templates

4. Mobile view support

5. Integration with popular IDEs

6. Automated documentation generation

## Success Metrics

- User engagement (time spent in workspace)

- Number of collaborative sessions

- Export frequency

- User retention rate

- Error rate in SQL parsing

- Customer satisfaction score

## Development Phases

### Phase 1
